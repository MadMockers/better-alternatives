This is a proof of concept for better solution of 'update-alternatives'

Code is messy / buggy / hodgepodged / will likely segfault
Written between the hours of 10PM and 3AM

'alternatives' file format:
<alternative_name> <path/to/option> <priority>

e.g:
editor /usr/bin/vim 5

Search path:
$HOME/.alternatives
/etc/balternatives/$GROUP_ID.alternatives
/etc/balternatives/.alternatives

Default alternative settings go in /etc/balternatives/.alternatives
User customizations go in their home directory
